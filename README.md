# MLBOnBaseClassification
This was project designed to employ basic data science principles in order to classify whether or not a given batter will get on base or get out. Using a repository found on Kaggle, we explore the question in depth in our code and our subsequent write-up.

Please see our paper for a detailed description and explanation of the analysis performed.
